Hangman Game (Flutter • Web)

An elegant Hangman / Guess-the-Word game built with Flutter and Provider.
Features a gradient/glass UI, animated word card (shake on wrong guess), Hint button (reveals one letter and costs 1 life), and confetti on win. Works great on the web (Chrome).

## Features:

State management: Provider (ChangeNotifier)

Gameplay

6 wrong guesses allowed → Lose

Letter reveals in all positions (e.g., “HAPPY” → _ _ P P _)

Repeated guesses are ignored (don’t cost a life)

Play Again gives a different word (no repeats until pool resets)

Hint reveals one random hidden letter and costs 1 life

UI/UX

Gradient background + glassmorphism cards

Animated status banner (Playing / WON / LOST)

## How It Works (Logic Overview)

GameState holds:

_word: current target word (e.g., FLUTTER)

_guessed: set of guessed letters ({'A','B','F',...})

_wrong: count of wrong guesses

_status: playing | won | lost

guessLetter(letter):

Ignores repeats and non A–Z characters

If letter is in the word → reveal all its positions

If all letters revealed → status = won

If not in the word → _wrong++

If _wrong >= 6 → status = lost and reveal the word

useHint():

Picks one random hidden letter, reveals it, and adds 1 wrong

Can cause win (if last letter) or lose (if lives run out)

newRound():

Picks a different word (no repeats until pool exhausted), resets state

## Run Locally (Web)

Use Chrome. If Edge debugger throws errors, prefer Chrome.

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome


If your Flutter version doesn’t support --web-renderer flags, just omit them (as above).
If you want the older HTML renderer:
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html (works on some versions)

## Quick Checks / Troubleshooting

Pages link not showing

Ensure docs/index.html, docs/404.html, docs/.nojekyll are in GitHub

Re-deploy using the commands above

Check Environments → github-pages → View deployment

Edge web crash

Use Chrome: flutter run -d chrome

Dependency warnings

They are just newer versions available; not errors.

Deleted platform folders

You can recreate them anytime: flutter create .
